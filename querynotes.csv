Messages:
1. Totals are not available for these results due to suppression constraints. More Information:
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/faq.html#Privacy.
2. Rows with zero Incidence Counts are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show zero rows.
3. Rows with suppressed Incidence Counts are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show suppressed rows.

Footnotes:
1. Data for in situ Breast Cancers are not included in this dataset.
2. Caution should be used when interpreting these Mortality Incidence Rate Ratios as coding for death certificates and cancer
incidence records may vary significantly. The cancer incidence records are likely to be coded to a more specific topographic
site which may give a false impression of an elevated rate ratio. Ratio values greater than 1 are flagged as Unreliable.

Caveats:
1. 'Suppressed' is displayed for data values when they must not be provided in order to protect personal privacy. Data is
"suppressed if fewer than 16 cases are reported in any one line of the results table. Data for the ""Asian / Pacific Islander"""
"and ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" race categories are suppressed at the Metropolitan Statistical Area level for"
"populations less than 50,000 persons. Data are suppressed at the state and Metropolitan Statistical Area level for certain race"
"and ethnicity groups: 1) ""American Indian or Alaska Native"" race data are suppressed at the state and MSA level for Delaware,"
"Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, and New York; 2) ""Asian or Pacific Islander"" race data are suppressed at the state and"
"MSA level for Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, and Kentucky; 3) ""Hispanic"" ethnicity data are supressed at the state and MSA level"
"for Delaware, and Kentucky. 4) All combinations of race by ethnicity are supressed at the state and MSA level for Delaware,"
"Kansas, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. More information:"
http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/CancerMIR-v2018.html#Confidentiality.
2. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for all data values when sex-specific cancers are combined with the wrong sex. More
information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/CancerMIR-v2018.html#Genital Cancers List.
"3. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for Population when it is not available, and for Age Adjusted Rate, and Mortality-Incidence"
Rate Ratio when they cannot be calculated due to lack of denominator population.
"4. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites because aggregate values are displayed in the"
table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be misleading.
"5. About rate comparisons: <ul><li> For consistency with the data on cancer incidence, the cancer sites in mortality data were"
"grouped according to the revised SEER recodes dated March 1, 2018 (see SEER Cause of Death Recodes:"
"http://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/.). Because NCHS uses different groupings for some sites, the death rates in this report may"
"differ slightly from those published by NCHS. In addition, under the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), there are"
"differences in mortality and incidence coding. For example, there are several codes for mesothelioma in ICD-10 (depending on the"
"primary site). However in ICD-O-3, one code captures all of the primary sites that mesothelioma affects. Note that Kaposi"
"sarcoma deaths included in this dataset are only those deaths with underlying cause of death attributed to Kaposi Sarcoma, and"
"do not include deaths where the condition was a contributing cause of death, or subsequent to another underlying condition."
"</li><li> The population used to age-adjust the rates in this report is the 2000 U.S. standard population, which is in"
accordance with a 1998 recommendation of the US. Department of Health and Human Services. The 2000 U.S. standard population is
"based on the proportion of the 2000 population in specific age groups (younger than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years,"
"15-19 years, . . . 85 years or older); the proportions of the 2000 population in these age groups serve as weights for"
"calculating age-adjusted incidence and death rates. NCHS, however, uses a different set of age groups in its age adjustment of"
"death rates, and thus the cancer death rates in this report may differ slightly from those published by NCHS. </li><li> Deaths"
of persons of unknown age are not included in this data set. Death rates may differ slightly from other reports where deaths of
persons of unknown age are included. </li></ul>
"6. Cancer incidence counts, populations, and rates may differ from those found in the United States Cancer Statistics incidence"
"reports and data, because these data include only those specific cancer sites that can be linked to the mortality data. For"
"example, in situ breast cancers are not included, and the appendix is not specified as a cancer site here."
"7. Cancer mortality counts, populations, and rates may differ from those found in the United States Cancer Statistics mortality"
"reports and data, because these data include only those specific reporting populations that can be linked to the incidence data."
"For example, cancer incidence data are not available for all places and years."
"8. For the 2005 year, the Census Bureau estimates that 203,937 persons were displaced from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and"
Texas due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. CDC WONDER does not include the displaced persons in the 2005 population counts for
"these states, nor are these counts included in the summary populations for the affected division, regions or national"
"population. However, the USCS web site does include these displaced persons in the national population figures for 2005."
9. Incidence data are from selected statewide and metropolitan area cancer registries that meet data quality criteria. Data
