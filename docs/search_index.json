[["index.html", "Cancer Deaths Rate Research Chapter 1 Introduction", " Cancer Deaths Rate Research Yingtong Peng and Xiaoran Hu 2022-05-02 Chapter 1 Introduction This data is chosen because we are concerned about health problems, especially cancer. In the United States, more than 1.6 million of people are diagnosed with cancer each year, around 600000 people die because of cancer. Cancer has been regarded as the second leading cause of death. Thus, what effects cancer death rate becomes an important topic for researchers. In this project, the relationship between potential factors and cancer deaths is studied. The three main questions we are interested in are: 1. What are the variables that have relationship with cancer incidence counts? The potential variables we want to study are leading cancer site, sex, race and region. 2. For a certain cancer, does gender has an effect for this cancer? We focus on breast cancer, as NCI stated that some new studies suggested men may be more likely than women to die after being diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly during the first 5 years after diagnosis(https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/male-breast-cancer-higher-mortality), we assume that gender effect the incidence counts for breast cancer. We want to check this assumption. 3. Does the death rate change with the increasing year of diagnosis? Due to the development of medical techniques, the death rate may decrease with the increasing year of diagnosis. Whether this assumption is correct needs to be checked. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the link to the data is https://wonder.cdc.gov/cancer.html. The data was from The United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) which are the official federal statistics on cancer incidence from registries having high-quality data and cancer mortality statistics for 50 states and the District of Columbia. And USCS are produced by CDC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). All of USCS contributors and partners are responsible for collecting this data. Since our data contains incidence data and mortality data, the incidence data are provided by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). Cancer mortality data for deaths after 2018 are available from NVSS. There are several choices to request a data form, firstly we choose group results by leading cancer sites and by year, sex, race, and region, then choose measures to contain death counts and incidence counts. Secondly, we select locations by state. Finally, we choose data to contain all year, sex, race, and region. This data contains some information about leading cancer sites, mortality-incidence rate which is age-adjusted, and patients personal information such as sex, race, region, and year of diagnosis. Among our dataset, Leading Cancer Sites, Year, Sex, Race, Region are categorical variables, and Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio, Death Counts, Incidence Counts are continuous variables. The data contains 11264 observations. Interestingly, we find that the death counts in some observations are 0, which means that no death in that observation, resulting in the morality-incidence rate ratio being not applicable. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation This data contains both the data and metadata. We can separate them into two data frames, one for data and the other one for metadata and store them separately.

First of all, the missing values of top 10 rows is following: ## [1] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Since in our data, there is only one variable contains NA(Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio), the output of the row sum of NA is 1. The missing values by column is following: ## Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio ## 2341 ## Leading Cancer Sites ## 0 ## Leading Cancer Sites Code ## 0 ## Year ## 0 ## Year Code ## 0 ## Sex ## 0 ## Sex Code ## 0 ## Race ## 0 ## Race Code ## 0 ## Region ## 0 ## Region Code ## 0 ## Death Counts ## 0 ## Incidence Counts ## 0 There are 2429 NAs in Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio. From the above plot, it can be seen that the only one type of Leading Cancer Sites(the part of body which has cancer) that does not have missing value is Gallbladder, and all other types have missing values. From the above plot, it can be seen that both male and female have missing value. From the above plot, it can be seen that the regarding the race, only Other Races and Unknown combined has missing values. From the above region plot we can find that all types of regions have missing values. From the above plots, it can be seen that there are two missing patterns. There is just one variable contains pattern 2, that is Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio. The number of rows does not contain missing values is greater than 7500, which almost three times of the number of rows contain NA. In our data, there is only one variable that contains missing valuesMortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio. I think since one of our project question uses it as the response variable, we can set the missing values in this variable to zero. Since the death count in this case is zero. If we just remove the missing values, it can impact our analysis because there are around 2000 missing values, which is one fifth of our data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variables that have relationship with cancer incidence counts. 5.2 The relationship between gender and breast cancer. 5.3 The change of death rate with the increasing year of diagnosis of top 12 Leading Cancer Sites.", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variables that have relationship with cancer incidence counts. Since the death count in this case is zero, we can replace these missing values by 0. Since the incidence counts is a quantitative variable, we can transform this variable to several categorical groups such as &lt; 500, 500 - 1000, 1000 - 1500, 1500 - 2000, &gt;2000. ## # A tibble: 6 x 13 ## `Leading Cancer S~ `Leading Cancer ~ Year `Year Code` Sex `Sex Code` Race ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F Asian~ ## 2 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F Black~ ## 3 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F Black~ ## 4 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F Black~ ## 5 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F Black~ ## 6 Brain and Other N~ 31010-31040 1999 1999 Fema~ F White ## # ... with 6 more variables: Race Code &lt;chr&gt;, Region &lt;chr&gt;, Region Code &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio &lt;dbl&gt;, Death Counts &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Incidence Counts &lt;chr&gt; Mosaic plot gives an overview of the data and makes it possible to recognize relationships between different variables[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot#:~:text=It%20gives%20an%20overview%20of,on%20by%20Friendly%20in%201994.] . Hence we can use mosaic plot to determine the variables that have strong relationship with cancer incidence counts. Although we cannot recognize each leading cancer site, the distribution of incidence counts varies slightly among leading cancer sites. Hence we can say the leading cancer site has effect on incidence counts. We can see that there is not obvious difference between female and male, so Sex does not have significant relationship with incidence counts. There is a noticeable trend that the distribution of incidence counts varies quite significantly. Thus, race has strong effect on incidence counts. White people have a greatest risk of cancer, and American indian people have a greatest risk of cancer. The distribution of incidence counts varies slightly among regions. Hence we can say the regions has weak effect on incidence counts. To summarize, race seems to have the strongest association with Incidence counts. 5.2 The relationship between gender and breast cancer. We aim to find a type of cancer that has largest incidence counts. ## # A tibble: 22 x 2 ## `Leading Cancer Sites` Freq ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Breast 4432442 ## 2 Lung and Bronchus 4237328 ## 3 Prostate 4178907 ## 4 Colon and Rectum 2928387 ## 5 Urinary Bladder 1366819 ## 6 Melanoma of the Skin 1287768 ## 7 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 1265074 ## 8 Kidney and Renal Pelvis 1025166 ## 9 Leukemias 891625 ## 10 Corpus Uteri 872060 ## # ... with 12 more rows From the above table we can see that breast cancer has the largest incidence counts. And from a research, men had higher death rates than women across all stages of breast cancer, even after the researchers adjusted for differences in patients clinical characteristics, such as the type and stage of disease, treatments received, age, race/ethnicity, and access to care. [https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2019/male-breast-cancer-higher-mortality#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20men%20had,ethnicity%2C%20and%20access%20to%20care.] We want to verify this statement. Firstly, we use boxplot to see the distribution of Mortality-Incidence Age-Adjusted Rate Ratio by gender for breast cancer. From the boxplot, male has higher death rates than female. And there are 4 outliers for male. Boxplots allow us to see the outliers and medians while ridgeline plots allow us to easily compare distributions of the death rate ratio. From the above ridgeline plot, we can easily find that the mode of male is around 0.225, and the mode of female is 0 and 0.15. And the distribution of rate ratio of male is unimodal while the distribution of female is bimodal. 5.3 The change of death rate with the increasing year of diagnosis of top 12 Leading Cancer Sites. Firstly, we determine the 12 Leading Cancer Sites with the highest death rate. ## [1] &quot;Esophagus&quot; &quot;Pancreas&quot; ## [3] &quot;Liver&quot; &quot;Lung and Bronchus&quot; ## [5] &quot;Gallbladder&quot; &quot;Brain and Other Nervous System&quot; ## [7] &quot;Ovary&quot; &quot;Stomach&quot; ## [9] &quot;Myeloma&quot; &quot;Leukemias&quot; ## [11] &quot;Larynx&quot; &quot;Colon and Rectum&quot; From the scatter plot, we find that although Prostate and Breast cancers have high incidence counts mean, the death counts are relatively low. But for Lung and Bronchus, Colon and Rectum cancers have high incidence counts and high death counts. By the above cleveland dot plot, Esophagus cancer has the highest mean mortality ratio. We transform year and death rate to several categorical groups. For year, we use 1999-2002, 2002-2006, 2006-2010, 2010-2014, 2014-2018, and for death rate, we break them to Low, Medium and High. ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## # Groups: Leading Cancer Sites [2] ## `Leading Cancer Sites` Year rate ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 Brain and Other Nervous System 1999-2002 Medium ## 2 Brain and Other Nervous System 2002-2006 Medium ## 3 Brain and Other Nervous System 2006-2010 Medium ## 4 Brain and Other Nervous System 2010-2014 Medium ## 5 Brain and Other Nervous System 2014-2018 Medium ## 6 Colon and Rectum 1999-2002 Low The alluvial diagram shows the movement of different Leading Cancer Sites and how they rank in terms of death rate over time. For example, we can see Myeloma went from the high rate in 1999-2002, then moved down to medium in 2002-2010, and moved down to low in 2010-2018. The heat map allows us to easily examine how one leading cancer site changes over time For example, Stomach cancer starts off as medium death rate, moves to low death rate. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In summary, firstly, we got results for the three question we raised in introduction. For the first question, we found that Leading Cancer Sites, Race, Region have effect on incidence counts. Race has the strongest effect. White people tends to have relatively bigger risk of cancer compared with other races, American Indian or Alaska Native has relatively smaller risk of cancer. But consider there are only 826 observations for American Indian or Alaska Native, other races all have about 2000-3500 observations, thus, the samples from American Indian or Alaska Native might be not representative due to the relatively small sample size. For the second question, we found that although sex appears to have no effect on cancer incidence counts, there can be some cancers that are highly related with sex. For breast cancer, male has higher death rate than female. In addition, the percentage of female that has zero mortality-incidence ratio is much larger than that of male. For the third question, we found that most of the top 12 cancer have decreasing death rate over time except Esophagus and Pancreas. We think it is because the improvement of medical technique and people have more robust health insurance today than 20 years ago. Our study is meaningful because scientists should know which cancer has higher death rate and make more efforts to reduce the death rate of these types of cancer. For example, the death rate of Esophagus and Pancreas did not decrease in the last 20 years, which is a problem that should be noticed. Next time, we can get some data about cure rate for different cancer for different countries. We can plot the cure rate vs year plot and facet by continent.
